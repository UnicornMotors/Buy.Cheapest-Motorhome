>Trying to get rid of Rv. Had to take down the post if you saw this before due to it taking longer than expected to get it home. 454 engine that I haven't gotten started/don't want to mess with. The genset started, but needs carb work. It has water damage. I have paperwork on it from the auction. If reasonable distance, I can help haul to you of you buy.

>$800  OBO.
Selling as is , would make a good parts vehicle. Title in hand, you come and get it.
460 V8 7.5L engine, automatic transmission, both in working condition, motor will start and run good,needs a starter, have to peck on the starter to get it started. needs a battery.
Single/dual axles with 16" wheels with good tire tread. All appliances go with it, frig., microwave, stove, sinks,shower, holding tank, comes with gas generator. Not wrecked, great frame. Outside hull needs scraped ,its no good on the front top, hole on top of cab. Ok I added two pictures of the hole in the cab. What this is we are looking at is where the over the cab bed was taken completely off and the hole that is covered by the plywood is where the walk threw was that you would walk from the camper part to the driver and passenger seat. We tried starting it to make sure it was going to start, but It does need a starter before it's drivable, starter is locked up.
Not Parting Out. All or nothing.
